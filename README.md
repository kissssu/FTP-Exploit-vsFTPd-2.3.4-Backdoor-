# FTP Exploit (vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor)
This Python script exploits a backdoor vulnerability in vsFTPd 2.3.4 to gain remote access. It triggers a backdoor via FTP and connects to the shell.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- **Pwntools**: Install with ```pip install pwntools```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script with the target IP. Optionally, specify a port.
Example:
```bash
python3 ftp_exploit.py <TARGET_IP> [PORT]
```
- <TARGET_IP>: The IP address of the vulnerable FTP server.
- [PORT]: Optional port (default is 21).

## How It Works
- **Verify the version** of vsFTPd. Only version 2.3.4 is vulnerable.
- **Trigger the backdoor** by sending a specific FTP user and pass.
- **Connect to the backdoor** on port 6200 and interact with the shell.
